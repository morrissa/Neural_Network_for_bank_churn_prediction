# Neural_Network_for_bank_churn_prediction
Simple neural network model to predict likelihood of a customer churning out of a bank.

The model uses a stacked architecture and was one of my first uses for neural network experimentation for predicting outcomes, compared to a random forest which is also popular within customer churn prediction.

The model is built in Keras, as this allows for a little faster experimentation with model parameters and design, rather than having to play with every small detail within tensorflow.

Definitely worth revisiting this model in the future, on my behalf.
